**Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study (Google Data Analytics Capstone)**



**Overview:**

This is my capstone project from the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate program.  

I analyzed 12 months of Cyclistic bike-share data to identify trends and recommend strategies for increasing annual memberships.



**Business Task:**

Determine how casual riders can be converted into annual members.



**Tools \& Technologies:**

* Excel (Data Cleaning)
* SQL (Data Analysis)
* Power BI (Visualization)
* Google Data Analytics Framework (ASK → PREPARE → PROCESS → ANALYZE → SHARE → ACT)



**Process:**

1\. Data Cleaning – Removed duplicates, standardized date formats, handled missing values.

2\. SQL Analysis – Aggregated ride duration, start/end stations, and seasonal patterns.

3\. Visualization – Created Power BI dashboard showing usage patterns.

4\. Recommendations – Suggested targeted marketing and membership offers.



**Key Insights:**

* Casual riders ride more in summer weekends; members use bikes year-round.
* Casual riders take longer trips, indicating leisure use.
* Targeting seasonal offers could help convert casual riders to members.

**Outcome:**

Recommendations can help Cyclistic increase membership revenue by aligning offers with riding patterns.
